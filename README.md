____Python Script for Training a CNN Model_____
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
The Python script consists of several .py files. Train.py is run to train the model and calls the other .py files as part of the training process.
The model will be created from the .py files and used in the Android component of this project. The script can be run to produce the model used in the image segmentation part of this project. 
Here are the steps to take to produce the model we used
1. Arrange the files in their directories in the project directory for the script. The train and predict files should go in the root directory and there should be a Dataset, output, and pyimageseach folders in the project directory.
The model.py, config.py, and dataset.py files should go in the pyimagesearch folder.
2. Run the train.py file in terminal or command prompt to produce the model. The running time should take a day or a day and a half on a computer with an i9-9900k and 64GB of RAM, running on GPUs should take less time.
